                <b>INTRODUCTION |</b>
                Content G58 is a census dataset of the population in New South Wales in 2016, counting of employed persons aged 15 years and over, which is about occupations. This data is sorting by suburb areas of NSW separated by different jobs in worked hours by gender.

                <b>TERMS DEFINITION |</b>
                Mesh blocks are small geographical units defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and combined to a larger building area used in a population census of several countries. In Australia, there are approximately 347000 Mesh blocks covering whole Australia without any gaps or overlaps. In addition, the whole mesh blocks are as a basis to form the whole geographical areas of Australia, called Statistical Areas Level 1 (SA1).<br>
                Data Journalism is about using data and number to discover and exposure the increased interaction between content producers and some other field such as design, computer science and statistics, which aims to find exploitable patterns for businesses. Data could help journalism better explain context and enhance the credibility by using graph, chart, or other statistic methods to analysis the big data resource. <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2017/investigations/florida-police-shootings/if-youre-black/"> <b>| EXAMPLE</b></a>
                <br><br><br>
                <b>THE DATASET |</b>
                Some public or private agencies might be interested in the G58 dataset: <br><br>
                The Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA)<br>
                This agency aims to improve and promote equality for both women and men, and support employers to remove barriers to the full and equal participations of women in the workplace.<br><br>
                Government Departments<br>
                The state and local government departments who interested in dealing with gender equality and workforce for the different occupations are needed this category to find out potential issues and address the problems.
                <br><br><br><br>
                <b>THE ANALYSIS |</b><br>  
                Firstly, this dataset provides the different occupations by worked hours by gender. The data I selected is focusing on the distribution of men and women worked in casual and normal in geological level, the entire number of men and women participated the jobs in each subsurb are also taking into considering. <br>
                Furthermore, visualising the percentage of workers in each occupation category by gender is more clearly to show the inequality of gender in some certain workplaces.
