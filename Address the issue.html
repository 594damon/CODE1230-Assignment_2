                    <h5>Based on the census data showed on the Mapbox, women likely prefer to work part-time in the residential area which around the highly commercialized area like Sydney SBD. However, the situation of men is totally different. They work full time in most of the suburbs excepting some area the western Sydney. The reason why the results of men and women are different is that women have to work part-time which allowing them to take care of families. This might due to the gender issue in the workplace or the stereotypes of the female must pay more attention to their families. This project is tried to reduce the travel time to the workplace or commercialized area, like Sydney CBD, from the western area of Sydney and to northern Sydney. This might engage more people to work in CBD.

                        <b>TRAFFIC ISSUE |</b><br>
                        It is clearly showed that for the people who lived in this area is quite difficult to travel to the Sydney CBD or North Sydney. If they own vehicles, it gonna take at least 20 minutes. And if they donâ€™t have cars, they have to use public transportation and it slightly increases the travel time. All these estimated travel time are based on the perfect traffic condition which assumes they might not meet traffic jam in the morning peak or evening peak. <br>
